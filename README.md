# mcpt-marketing

Deterministic marketing infrastructure for MCPT tools: **falsifiable claims**, **hash-verified evidence**, and **channel-ready messages** that stay traceable as the product evolves.

This repo defines **MarketIR** — a small, versioned "marketing intermediate representation" designed to be consumed by generators and the public site ([mcptoolshop.com](https://mcptoolshop.com)) without turning marketing into a manual, fragile process.

---

## What this is (and isn't)

**This is:**

- A structured source of truth for product messaging
- Claims that are explicitly labeled **proven** vs **aspirational**
- Evidence artifacts with **sha256 hashes + provenance**
- Messages that **must trace back to claims** — no drive-by assertions

**This is not:**

- A blog
- A CMS
- A place for vibes-based copy that can't be tested

## Core ideas

| Principle | What it means |
| --- | --- |
| **Proof-first** | Proven claims must link to evidence. No evidence, no "proven" badge. |
| **Deterministic** | Content is pinned by a lockfile. Hash drift fails CI. |
| **Composable** | Messages are views of claims for different channels and audiences. |
| **Honest** | Anti-claims prevent overreach. If a tool can't do something, say so. |

## Repository layout

```
marketing/
  schema/           # MarketIR JSON Schema (2020-12, versioned)
  data/
    tools/          # One file per tool (claims, messages, positioning)
    audiences/      # One file per audience (pain points, context)
    campaigns/      # One file per campaign (phases, channel sequences)
    marketing.index.json   # Root index — everything starts here
  evidence/         # Evidence artifacts (screenshots, reports), hash-addressed
  manifests/
    evidence.manifest.json   # Evidence registry with sha256 + provenance
    marketing.lock.json      # Lockfile pinning all files by hash
  scripts/          # validate, hash, gen-lock
```

### Authored vs generated

| Type | Files | Edited by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Authored** | `schema/**`, `data/**`, `evidence.manifest.json` | Humans |
| **Generated** | `marketing.lock.json` | `gen-lock.mjs` script |

Everything must be reachable from `marketing/data/marketing.index.json`. No orphan files.

## Determinism contract

### IDs are stable and permanent

IDs follow a namespace pattern and are **never renamed** — deprecate instead.

```
tool.<slug>              → tool.zip-meta-map
aud.<name>               → aud.ci-maintainers
claim.<tool>.<slug>      → claim.zip-meta-map.deterministic-output
ev.<tool>.<slug>.v<n>    → ev.zip-meta-map.build-screenshot.v1
msg.<tool>.<slug>        → msg.zip-meta-map.web-blurb
camp.<tool>.<slug>       → camp.zip-meta-map.launch
```

All IDs must be unique across the entire graph.

### Claim status is explicit

| Status | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| `proven` | Must include at least one `evidenceRef`. CI rejects proven claims with zero evidence. |
| `aspirational` | Allowed, but must be labeled. Upgrade to proven only when evidence is added. |
| `deprecated` | Kept for audit trail. Never deleted. |

### Evidence is hash-verified

Every evidence artifact includes `sha256`, `bytes`, and a `provenance` object (generator, source commit, notes). This makes evidence tamper-evident and reproducible.

### Lockfile is canonical

`marketing.lock.json` pins every included file by hash. CI regenerates the lockfile and fails if it differs from what's committed. Same data, same build, every time.

### Messages trace to claims

Every message references claims via `claimRefs`. If a message asserts something not represented as a claim, validation fails.

### Deterministic serialization

All JSON uses sorted keys, stable array ordering, and trailing newlines. This prevents "same data, different diff" noise.

## Local workflow

```bash
npm install

# Format check (Prettier)
npm run format:check

# Schema + invariant validation
npm run validate

# Lockfile drift check (CI mode)
npm run lock:check
```

**Typical development loop:**

1. Edit or add files under `marketing/data/**`
2. Add evidence entries to `marketing/manifests/evidence.manifest.json` (and artifacts under `marketing/evidence/` if applicable)
3. Regenerate the lockfile: `node marketing/scripts/gen-lock.mjs`
4. Validate: `npm run validate`
5. Format: `npm run format:check` (fix with `npm run format`)

## How it's consumed (site bridge)

The public site treats this repo as a **read-only upstream**. No runtime fetches — everything is resolved at build time.

```
mcpt-marketing (MarketIR, this repo)
        │
        │  fetch + sha256 verification (lockfile-enforced)
        ▼
vendor snapshot (build-time, gitignored in site repo)
        │
        │  Astro static build
        ▼
mcptoolshop.com
```

The site's `fetch-marketir.mjs` script downloads files referenced in the lockfile, verifies every hash, and writes a local snapshot. If any hash mismatches, the build aborts. This keeps marketing traceable and reproducible.

---

## Contribution rules

The quality bar is simple and non-negotiable:

- **Every claim must be falsifiable** — testable in principle, not just feel-good copy
- **Upgrade aspirational → proven** only when you add evidence
- **Messages must reference claims** — if it's said, it must be claimed
- **Add anti-claims** whenever a tool is likely to be misused or misunderstood
- **No orphan content** — everything must be reachable from the index

---

## Security

No secrets, private URLs, API keys, or customer identifiers belong in this repo. Evidence means public artifacts — screenshots, CI links, test results — not internal logs or credentials. If something can't be shown publicly, it's not evidence.

---

## Versioning

MarketIR changes are versioned via `schemaVersion` in the schema and data files. Breaking changes (renamed fields, removed properties, structural changes) require a major bump. Additive changes (new optional fields, new `$defs`) are minor. Downstream consumers like the site bridge should check `schemaVersion` compatibility before ingesting.
